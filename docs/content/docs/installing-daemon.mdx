title: Installing a Daemon
description: How to install and deploy Scanopy daemons on your networks.
---

Daemons are lightweight agents that perform network discovery. Deploy daemons on each network segment you want to scan.

## Requirements

- **Linux**: Docker with host networking OR standalone binary
- **macOS**: Standalone binary only — Docker Desktop doesn't allow access to host interfaces
- **Windows**: Standalone binary only — Docker Desktop doesn't allow access to host interfaces
  - **Additional Windows Requirement**: Install [Npcap](https://npcap.com/#download) to enable ARP-based host discovery. Without  Npcap, the daemon will use port scanning as a fallback (slower, less reliable for detecting hosts without open ports).

## Creating a Daemon

1. Navigate to **Manage > Daemons** in the Scanopy UI
2. Click **"Create Daemon"**
3. Select the target network
4. Select daemon mode:
   - **Pull** (recommended): Daemon polls server for work — no inbound firewall rules needed
   - **Push**: Server initiates scans — daemon must be reachable from server
5. Click **"Generate Key"** to create an API key
6. Copy either the Docker Compose or binary installation command

## Managing Daemons

**Updating daemon properties**:

You can update all daemon properties after creation by editing the daemon's config file; however, you'll need to restart the daemon for property updates to take effect.

Name, Mode, and URL will be propagated to the server if changed. All other properties are local to the daemon and not stored on the server.

To update daemon capabilities (docker socket integration and interfaced subnets), you'll need to run a SelfReport discovery to report the new capabilities to the server.

**Deleting a daemon**: Click the delete icon. You'll also need to uninstall the daemon from the host it's running on.

**Important**: Deleting a daemon does NOT delete discovered data. Hosts, services, and topology remain until explicitly deleted.

## Daemon Capabilities

Each daemon reports its capabilities:

**Docker Socket Access**

- **True**: Can discover Docker containers
- **False**: Cannot access Docker socket

**Interfaced Subnets**

- Lists which subnets the daemon has network interfaces with
- The daemon will scan these subnets by default during network discovery

## Uninstalling

**Removing config manually**

If you need to reset a daemon without fully uninstalling, you can do so by removing the config file. On starting the daemon, look for a log line that starts with `Loaded daemon runtime state from...` followed by the path to the config file. If you remove the file at this path, the daemon will re-create a new config the next time it starts up.

**Docker:**

```bash
docker stop scanopy-daemon
docker rm scanopy-daemon
```

**Linux/macOS binary:**

```bash
# Stop systemd service (if installed)
sudo systemctl stop scanopy-daemon
sudo systemctl disable scanopy-daemon
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/scanopy-daemon.service

# Remove binary
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/scanopy-daemon

# Remove configuration
rm -rf ~/.config/scanopy/  # Linux
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.scanopy.daemon/  # macOS
```

**Windows:**

1. Stop the daemon process
2. Delete the executable
3. Remove configuration from `%APPDATA%\scanopy\daemon\`

### What Happens to Your Data

Uninstalling a daemon does **not** delete discovered data. All hosts, services, subnets, and topology data remain on the server until you explicitly delete them.

The daemon record will still appear in **Manage > Daemons** until you delete it there.

### Can I Migrate a Daemon?

No. Daemons discover host-specific data (network interfaces, Docker containers, local services) that's tied to the machine they run on. Moving a daemon's identity to a different host would result in inaccurate visualizations.

If you're replacing a host, create a new daemon on the new machine and delete the old one.
