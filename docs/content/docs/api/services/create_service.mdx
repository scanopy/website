title: Create a new service
icon: POST
description: >-
  Creates a service with optional bindings to interfaces or ports.

  The `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `source` fields are generated
  server-side.

  Bindings are specified without `service_id` or `network_id` - these are
  assigned automatically.


  ## Binding Validation Rules


  - **Cross-host validation**: All bindings must reference ports/interfaces that
  belong to the
    service's host. Bindings referencing entities from other hosts will be rejected.
  - **Deduplication**: Duplicate bindings in the same request are automatically
  deduplicated.

  - **All-interfaces precedence**: If a port binding with `interface_id: null`
  (all interfaces)
    is included, any specific-interface bindings for the same port are automatically removed.
  - **Conflict detection**: Interface bindings conflict with port bindings on
  the same interface.
    A port binding on all interfaces conflicts with any interface binding.
