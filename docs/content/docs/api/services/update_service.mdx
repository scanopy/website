title: Update a service
icon: PUT
description: >-
  Updates an existing service. All binding validation rules from service
  creation apply here as well.


  ## Binding Validation Rules


  - **Cross-host validation**: All bindings must reference ports/interfaces that
  belong to the
    service's host. Bindings referencing entities from other hosts will be rejected.
  - **Deduplication**: Duplicate bindings are automatically deduplicated.

  - **All-interfaces precedence**: If a port binding with `interface_id: null`
  (all interfaces)
    is included, any specific-interface bindings for the same port are automatically removed.
  - **Conflict detection**: Interface bindings conflict with port bindings on
  the same interface.
