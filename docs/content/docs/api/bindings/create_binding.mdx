title: Create a new binding
icon: POST
description: >-
  Creates a binding that associates a service with a port or interface.


  ## Binding Types


  - **Interface binding**: Service is present at an interface (IP address)
  without a specific port.
    Used for non-port-bound services like gateways.
  - **Port binding (specific interface)**: Service listens on a specific port on
  a specific interface.

  - **Port binding (all interfaces)**: Service listens on a specific port on all
  interfaces
    (`interface_id: null`).

  ## Validation and Deduplication Rules


  - **Conflict detection**: Interface bindings conflict with port bindings on
  the same interface.
    A port binding on all interfaces conflicts with any interface binding for the same service.
  - **All-interfaces precedence**: When creating a port binding with
  `interface_id: null`,
    any existing specific-interface bindings for the same port are automatically removed,
    as they are superseded by the all-interfaces binding.
