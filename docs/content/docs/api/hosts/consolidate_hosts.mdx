title: Consolidate hosts
icon: PUT
description: >-
  Merges all interfaces, ports, and services from `other_host` into

  `destination_host`, then deletes `other_host`. Both hosts must be

  on the same network.


  ## Merge Behavior


  - **Interfaces**: Transferred to destination. If an interface with matching
  subnet+IP or MAC
    already exists on destination, bindings are remapped to use the existing interface.
  - **Ports**: Transferred to destination. If a port with the same number and
  protocol already
    exists, bindings are remapped to use the existing port.
  - **Services**: Transferred to destination with deduplication.
    See [upsert behavior](https://scanopy.net/docs/discovery/#upsert-behavior) for details.

  ## Restrictions


  - Cannot consolidate a host with itself.

  - Cannot consolidate a host that has a daemon - consolidate into it instead.
