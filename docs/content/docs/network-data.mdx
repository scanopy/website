## Hosts

Hosts represent devices on your network. They are automatically discovered during network scans.

### Consolidating Duplicate Hosts

When a device appears on multiple VLANs or through different discovery methods, it may be discovered as separate hosts. Use consolidation to merge them:

1. Open the host you want to keep (primary)
2. Click **Consolidate**
3. Select the duplicate host(s) to merge
4. Confirm

The primary host gains all interfaces, services, and properties from the merged hosts. Use this to unify a server that has interfaces on multiple VLANs into a single logical host.

### Unclaimed Open Ports

Ports discovered without a matching service definition are assigned to an "Unclaimed Open Ports" placeholder. To reassign them:

1. Open the host and go to the **Services** tab
2. Select ports from "Unclaimed Open Ports"
3. Click **Transfer Ports** on the service you want to assign them to

Useful when Scanopy detects an open port but can't identify the service running on it.

### Virtualization Relationships

Scanopy tracks which VMs and containers run on which hosts:

- **Proxmox**: Links VMs and LXC containers to their Proxmox host
- **Docker**: Links containers to their Docker host

These relationships appear in the topology and host details, showing your virtualization hierarchy.

### Service Detection

Scanopy automatically detects 200+ services. See [Service Detection](/service-detection/) for how detection works, confidence levels, and what to do when a service isn't found.

### Hiding Hosts

Mark hosts as hidden to flag them for exclusion from the topology. Hidden hosts remain in the database with all their services, interfaces, and discovery history intact.

To toggle visibility:

1. Go to **Manage > Hosts**
2. Click the **Hide** button (eye icon) on the host card

The button turns blue when a host is hidden. Use the **Hidden** column filter to find hidden hosts.

**When to use:**

- Flag decommissioned devices that shouldn't appear in diagrams
- Mark infrastructure hosts that clutter the visualization (PDUs, UPS units, management interfaces)
- Identify test or development hosts to exclude from production views

After hiding a host, rebuild the topology for changes to take effect.

## Subnets

Subnets represent network segments. Scanopy automatically detects subnets during discovery, but you can also create them manually. Assign a type (LAN, WiFi, DMZ, etc.) to label your subnets for filtering and organization.

### Organizational Subnets

Two special subnet types use CIDR `0.0.0.0/0` and serve as organizational containers rather than real network segments:

**Internet** — For public/external services:

- Public DNS servers (1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8)
- Cloud services your network connects to
- External APIs

**Remote** — For hosts not on your local network:

- Mobile devices connecting via VPN
- Remote office machines
- Friend's servers you want to track

## Groups

Groups create logical connections between services for topology visualization. They don't affect how Scanopy discovers or scans — they're purely for showing relationships that network topology alone doesn't capture.

```
Hub and Spoke                      Path

     ┌─────────┐
     │ Web App │
     └────┬────┘
          │
┌───────┐ │ ┌────────┐

└───────┘ │ └────────┘
          │
     ┌────┴────┐
     │  Admin  │
     └─────────┘
```

Use **Hub and Spoke** when multiple services connect to a central one (database clients, API consumers). Use **Path** for linear flows (request routing, data pipelines, backup chains).

Manage groups via **Manage > Groups**.
