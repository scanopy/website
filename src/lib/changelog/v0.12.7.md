## New Features

- Add service definitions for Forgejo, Gitea, and Frigate, expanding the range of network services Scanopy can detect and visualize ([#377](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/377), [#381](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/381)).
- Introduce OpenAPI specification for all API endpoints and generate frontend types directly from OpenAPI, improving API reliability and making it easier to build integrations ([#371](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/371), [#380](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/380)).

## Improvements

- Update database schema to be fully relational, replacing JSON storage with dedicated tables for enhanced performance, consistency, and query capabilities ([#371](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/371)).
- Replace frontend state and form libraries with TanStack, resulting in smoother UI interactions
