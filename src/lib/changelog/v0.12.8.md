# Scanopy v0.12.8 Release Notes

## Improvements

- Add a label to the Docker image for Kamal deployments and fix community invite functionality, making integration and onboarding smoother for users ([#393](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/393)).

## Bug Fixes

- Fix the registration environment variable handling so that disabling registration works as expected, improving control over access in managed deployments ([#386](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/386)).
- Fix a bug where daemon re-registry could create duplicate hosts, ensuring network maps remain accurate and free of redundancies ([#391](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/391)).
- Fix port deduplication during network discovery, preventing multiple records for the same port and resulting in cleaner host details ([#392](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/392)).
- Fix the migration script for upgrading to v0.12.7+
