## New Features

- Add topology sharing capabilities, allowing users to share network maps via direct link or embed code for easier collaboration and presentation ([#331](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/331)).
- Introduce demo mode with demo.scanopy.net for quick evaluation and public showcases, making it easier for new users to try Scanopy without setup ([#345](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/345)).

## Improvements

- Improve subnet visualization by optimizing horizontal compression and preventing overlap, resulting in clearer network maps ([#339](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/339)).
- Persist topology map settings and improve interface edge labeling, so user preferences are retained and connections are easier to interpret ([#341](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/341)).
