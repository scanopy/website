## New Features

- Add topology sharing capabilities, allowing users to share network maps via direct link or embed code, making collaboration and presentation easier ([#345](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/345)).
- Introduce demo mode with login support for a demo account and dedicated host, enabling users to explore Scanopy’s features without a full setup ([#346](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/346)).

## Improvements

- Improve subnet visualization by optimizing horizontal compression and preventing overlap, resulting in clearer network maps ([#339](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/339)).
- Improve error messages when daemon network IDs change, helping users better understand network mismatches ([#342](https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy/pull/342)).
- Persist topology settings across sessions and display more accurate interface edge labels for a consistent user experience ([#341](https://github.com/scanopy/
